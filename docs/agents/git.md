# Git Workflow

- Prefer `chore:`, `refactor:`, `feat:`, `fix:` prefixes for commit messages.
- Issue references appear as `[GHI#<id>]` when applicable.
- Keep commit messages short and action-oriented.
- For pull requests, include a clear summary, link related issues, and add screenshots when UI changes are involved.
